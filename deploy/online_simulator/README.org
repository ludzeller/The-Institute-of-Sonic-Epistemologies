#+TITLE: The Institute of Sonic Epistemologies Online Simulator

This is an online simulator for the installation, which allows for an interactive access to the binaural audio tracks based on the floor plan of the installation.

The simulator consists of a simple HTML page with some Javascript functionality.  The version found here, [[file:ise_simulator.html]], was conceived for a Raspberry Pi with a small touchscreen of 480x320 pixels resolution to be used as a demo kiosk system in exhibitions.

An adapted desktop version running in your browser can be found at [[https://rumori.iem.sh/The_Institute_of_Sonic_Epistemologies/ise_simulator_desktop.html]].
