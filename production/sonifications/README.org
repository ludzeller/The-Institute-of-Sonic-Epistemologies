#+TITLE: Sonification notes of Sonic Epistemologies

Besides recorded sounds (i.e. voices and noises) the project also makes use of synthesised sounds that have been freshly created or have been used from historic sources. 

** Fictive sounds and sonifications

The sounds of the fictive sonification device discussed and presented in scene C (~ 4'00'' - 5'20'') have also been created using Processing and Minim in addition to the Fisica library, a Processing wrapper of JBox2D. The code is available in the folder [[file:materiality_of_data][materiality_of_data]] and offers a sine wave swarm synth based on a network of simulated mechanical springs. The tool allows for the flexible configuration of simulated network. 

Each dynamic node is decorated with one sine wave oscillator that together sum up as an additive swarm sound, at times resembling mechanical springs. The volume and pitch of these connections is influenced by their velocity. The stereo panorama is mapped according to their horizontal position on screen.

Various parameters of the physical simulation can be adjusted in real-time using the following commands:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ADD NODES  
- add dynamic nodes: press 'a' and click left
- add static nodes: press 'f' and click left
- adjust ball size: press 'u' and move mouse horizontally

LINK NODES
- link nodes: press 's' and click several nodes
- connect neighbouring nodes: press 'n'
- connect neighbour nodes to static anchors: press 'm'

RANDOMIZE
- randomize: press 'r'
- adjust amount of generated nodes: press 'z' and move mouse horizontally
- adjust auto-link probability: press 't' and move mouse horizontally

REMOVE
- remove single nodes: press 'd' and click left on nodes
- reset everything: press 'c'

PHYSICS
- adjust spring damping: press 'w' and move mouse horizontally
- adjust spring frequency: press 'q' and move mouse horizontally
- adjust spring length: press 'e' and move mouse horizontally
- trigger showing of physics parameters: press 'h'

EXITOR
- excite single nodes by mouse-dragging them 
- excite network around mouse cursor: press 'x'
- adjust excitation range: press 'i' and move mouse horizontally
- adjust excitation power: press 'o' and move mouse horizontally
#+END_EXAMPLE

The sonification sounds heard in scene D and E have been created using the [[http://imtr.ircam.fr/imtr/CataRT][CatArt]] (Real-Time Corpus-Based Concatenative Synthesis) tool by IRCAM. Recordings of physically excited objects have been used as source material, chopped into grains and sorted according to their spectral brightness and loudness. 

The sounds of the "[[file:listening_exercise][listening exercise]]" in scene B have been created with a tiny tool written in Processing/Java using the Minim library. 

** Factual/historic sonifications

The historic sonification examples in scene C (~ 1'00'' - 3'00'') are factually existing sounds of algorithmic sonifications recorded by W. Nijenhuis at Philips in Eindhoven while working on the "PASCAL" computer in the early 1960s. A media historic discussion of this can be found in Miyazaki, Shintaro (2013). Algorhythmisiert. Eine Medienarchäologie digitaler Signale und (un)erhörter Effekte. Berlin: Kadmos Kulturverlag, p. 84ff.
